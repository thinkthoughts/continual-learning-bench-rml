**Continual Learning Bench** measures how well AI agents learn from past environment interactions, the defining challenge for agents that operate over extended horizons and are expected to improve online.

## Quickstart

Continual Learning Bench requires Python 3.13 or later, [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), and a local Docker installation for tasks and systems that run containerized workspaces.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pgasawa/continual-learning-bench && cd continual-learning-bench
uv sync --all-extras && source .venv/bin/activate
pre-commit install
clbench setup --all
```

Add any model provider keys you need to a `.env` file in the project root, then verify the CLI and run a small benchmark:

```bash
clbench list
clbench run exploitable_poker --schedule quick_test --system icl
```

The [Quickstart Guide](https://continual-learning-bench.com/docs/quickstart/) walks through the same flow in more detail, including how to inspect tasks, systems, schedules, and run outputs.

## Core Components

### Dataset of Tasks

Each task spans multiple episodes in a shared environment, so agents that remember feedback and adapt should outperform those that solve each instance from scratch. Tasks include:

- a set of constructed task instances with a learnable structure,
- an evaluation script and reward metric measuring improvement over episodes,
- schedules and variants for repeatable comparisons across systems.

Tasks live in `src/tasks/`. See the [Task Gallery](https://continual-learning-bench.com/tasks.html) for an overview that's easy to browse.

### Systems

Systems are the agents evaluated by the benchmark. Built-in baselines and model-backed systems live in `src/systems/`, and custom systems can be added to test new memory, retrieval, prompting, or tool-use strategies.

### Execution Harness

The harness connects systems to task environments, manages multi-episode rollouts, records traces, and writes viewer artifacts for analysis. After installing, explore available options with:

```bash
clbench run --help
clbench run-all --help
```
